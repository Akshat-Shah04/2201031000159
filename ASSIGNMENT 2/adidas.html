            <h1>History of Adidas Company</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Every great story has a beginning. This one started in a small town in Bavaria, Germany. After starting
                out in his mother’s wash kitchen, Adi Dassler registered the ‘Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik’ in 1924 and
                embarked on his mission to provide athletes with the best possible equipment. Gold medals in Amsterdam
                (1928, Lina Radke) and Berlin were first rewards and milestones – and only the start of our story.
            </p>

                alt="">
            <p>On August 18, 1949, Adi Dassler started over again at the age of 49, registered the ‘Adi Dassler adidas
                Sportschuhfabrik’ and set to work with 47 employees in the small town of Herzogenaurach. In the same
                year, he registered a shoe that included the registration of the soon-to-become-famous adidas 3-Stripes.
                From humble beginnings to a global success story – which was accelerated by a miracle…

                Who would have thought that screw-in studs on lightweight football boots would help write history? When
                the German national football team faced the unbeatable Hungarians in the 1954 World Cup final, they won
                so much more than just a trophy. Their unbelievable victory would be heard around the world for decades
                to come. And it made adidas and its founder a household name on football pitches everywhere.
            </p>

                What’s in a name? Everything, when you name it after a “Kaiser”. When the Franz Beckenbauer tracksuit
                model celebrated its debut, it became the first piece of apparel for adidas and opened a whole new
                business to a company that, so far, was famous for shoes.

            <h2> THE TREFOIL AND THE OLYMPIC IDEA</h2>
            <p> In 1972, the world turned to Germany when the Olympic Games opened in Munich. Just in time for the
                event,
                adidas presented a new logo that was here to stay: the Trefoil. Then, symbolizing performance. Today,
                the
                adidas Originals collection stands for lifestyle and street. Times may change, but trefoiled quality
                will
                always remain.</p><br>

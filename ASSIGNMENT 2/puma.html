                History of Puma Company
            </h1>
            <br>
            <p>Puma SE is a German multinational corporation that designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear,
                apparel, and accessories, headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. Puma is the third largest
                sportswear manufacturer in the world. The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler (1898–1974).

                In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebrüder Dassler
                Schuhfabrik ('Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory').

                <br><br><b> The relationship between the two brothers deteriorated
                    until they agreed to split in 1948, <u>forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma.</u> Following
                    the
                    split,
                    Rudolf originally registered the newly established company as Ruda (derived from Rudolf Dassler, as
                    Adidas was based on Adi Dassler), but later changed the name to Puma.</b> Puma's earliest logo
                consisted of
                a square and beast jumping through a D, which was registered, along with the company's name, in 1948.
                Puma's shoe and clothing designs feature the Puma logo and the distinctive "Formstrip" which was
                introduced in 1958.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the 1952 Summer Olympics, 1500 metres runner Josy Barthel of Luxembourg won Puma's first Olympic gold
                in Helsinki, Finland.

                At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Puma paid German sprinter Armin Hary to wear Pumas in the 100-metre sprint
                final. Hary had previously worn Adidas products and approached Adolf for compensation. However, Adidas
                declined the request. Despite winning a gold medal in Pumas, Hary chose to wear Adidas during the medals
                ceremony, surprising the two Dassler brothers. Hary seemingly aimed to benefit financially from both
                brands, but Adolf was infuriated to the extent of banning the Olympic champion.

                During the 1968 Olympics Black Power Salute, Puma-sponsored African-American athletes Tommie Smith and
                John Carlos, after having won gold and bronze in the 200 meters, respectively, took to the podium with
                their Puma Suede shoes in hand and bowed their heads and raised their black-gloved fists in silent
                protest during the playing of the national anthem, an act meant to stand up for human rights and to
                stand up for black Americans.
